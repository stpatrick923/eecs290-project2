Lerpz Odyssey
=========================

A platformer for EECS 290 Project 2. Features numerous obstacles, collectibles, etc.

There is also the capability to add another player, but this is implemented minimally (towards the end).
Also, due to time constraints, there is only one level (with 7 areas). The game was built to teach the
rudimentary components of the game as you progress through it (jumping, running, checkpoints, avoid shit trying to kill you, etc.).
